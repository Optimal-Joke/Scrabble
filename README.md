# Scrabble Score Keeper

This project is a simple CLI Scrabble score keeper. It is designed to be used during game play to keep track of words played and calculate scores.

This project is only my second in C++ after learning it over the past week. In each project, I'm trying to focus on a particular skill/aspect of the language. For this one, I put an emphasis on console text manipulation and making a nice experience for the user, as well as some basic Object-Oriented design.
